# Requirements

Script for Ubuntu Server without CLI. 
Maybe works on others Debian-based systems but without guarantee.

Use it on VirtualMachine!

## DO NOT RUN ON PRODUCTION SERVER.
This will create vulnerabilities and will turn your server into a black hole for malwares.
Run an VM exclusively to this and apply this code on it.
